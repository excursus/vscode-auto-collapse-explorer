# Auto-Collapse Explorer

This is a fork of [LukeGeneva's](https://github.com/LukeGeneva/vscode-auto-collapse-explorer) awesome extension of the same name, with the addition of a configuration itme which allows you to toggle the extension on and off.

Auto-Collapse Explorer attempts to keep the Explorer neat and tidy by only
expanding the directory of the file that is currently in focus. All directories
are closed.

## Features

When focus changes to a new document, that document is revealed in the file tree
and all other open folders are collapsed.

Thanks for trying out this extension! Hope you enjoy!

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. VS Code is not my everyday editor and
maintenance/enhancement of this extension suffers.
